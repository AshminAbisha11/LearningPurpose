Story Title - The Ginger bread man

Once upon a time there was an old man, an old woman, and a little boy.
 One morning the old woman made some gingerbread in the shape of a man. 
 She added icing for his hair and clothes, and little blobs of dough for his nose and eyes. 
 When she put him in the oven to bake, she said to the little boy,
 "You watch the gingerbread man while your grandfather and I go out to work in the garden."
